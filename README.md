# Predicting-Shift-in-Consumer-Behavior-Targeted-Advertising

Analyzed customer trends to identify bundled services to target potential customers using Deloitte’s Digital Survey Data (2009-2011)

Built a classification model to predict customer's willingness to move to an ad-supported streaming service at lower subscription fee

Performed customer segmentation using customer demographics, ad-preferences, device usage, and other market parameters


Project Summary:

The project aims to decipher the hidden insights inside a survey conducted by Deloitte. Deloitte, a multinational professional services network firm, conducted a survey across the United States of America in the year 2009,2010 and 2011. The survey was focused on media consumption habits and was utilized for Deloitte’s Digital Democracy report. 

We were able to derive critical business insights from the analysis of survey data. Additionally, predictive analytics helped us understand consumer behavior and willingness to pay for an Ad-supported video streaming platform. 

The objective of the project is to find useful insights for our clients using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. Results related to a product owned and tolerance towards advertisements will help us understand consumer behavior. These results will help our clients make better decisions for targeted advertisement and product placements on their online and offline platforms.
